Any code needs to go in the code cells, and any 'text' answer/description needs to go in the proper text cell. We will not be looking for answers randomly placed so please read the instructions.\n","\n","You are to use only the libraries provided in the next code cell. Any additional library is NOT allowed and will cause you to lose all the points that use said library's functions/functionality. You can use any functions given in the class code examples, but be very very careful of lifting anything \n","'as-is' from the internet as it will be considerered plagiarism. \n","\n","**IMPORTANT: Make sure you use 1234 (for the folds use: 3456, 5678, 7890) for your randomseed/random states.

It is the student's responsibility to be able to do this and no excuses will be accepted, no legible PDF = zero grade. So practice and test before submission time. This PDF should be named LastName_FirstName-Assignment3.PDF\n","\n","2) The student should create a GitHub repository for this assignment and properly title the repository Class_CODE-ClassName-AssignmentTwo. This repository should have a readme file and the Google Colab notebook in it. Note that colab can save a copy directly to GitHub so make sure you test this. Downloading the notebook file and uploading it directly will result in 200 points deduction. The link to your GitHub repository should be included as text/message in the iCollege submission drop, failure to include this link will result in a 100 point penalty. \n","\n","## Extra Credit for all:\n","\n","Any student can get 20 extra credit points by doing one simple thing:\n","\n","1) Make sure your repo for this assignment has a nice README file with figures and results. \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1739,"status":"ok","timestamp":1679971792779,"user":{"displayName":"Ryan Ferguson","userId":"10816876138900968403"},"user_tz":240},"id":"PjGD5VGFVS-s"},"outputs":[],"source":["############## These are the only imports allowed to solve this homework, so make sure you do not add anything else down below\n","\n","%matplotlib inline\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import sklearn \n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns; sns.set()\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"89_ilQegV-MS"},"source":["Using the Chess dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":5,"status":"ok","timestamp":1679971792779,"user":{"displayName":"Ryan Ferguson","userId":"10816876138900968403"},"user_tz":240},"id":"J_sakm7HV90A"},"outputs":[],"source":["### Manually download it and upload to this istance data sample space\n","### Note DO NOT change these operations or all your answers will be incorrect\n","\n","### Let's do some transformations and extra features on this.\n","df=pd.read_csv('games.csv', encoding='utf-8')\n","\n","# Difference between white rating and black rating - independent variable\n","df['rating_difference']=df['white_rating']-df['black_rating']\n","\n","# White wins flag (1=win vs. 0=not-win) - dependent (target) variable\n","df['white_win']=df['winner'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x=='white' else 0)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zTyRQCajE5Go"},"source":["For this assignment we will be using two columns as features only, and the white_win colum as the label."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4,"status":"ok","timestamp":1679971792779,"user":{"displayName":"Ryan Ferguson","userId":"10816876138900968403"},"user_tz":240},"id":"mv3OV1HJE4VZ"},"outputs":[],"source":["X=df[['rating_difference', 'turns']]\n","y=df['white_win'].values"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0TLvYCXVbHN9"},"source":["# Question 1 (10 points)\n","\n","Use sklearn to split this the data into testing and training data.
